I am listening to the book of Ryan Holiday on Stillness and realized that it's an exploration I have to make. 

Right now there are few ways in the book that's described on how to create stillness. 

# Domain of the Mind


# Journal

First one being - #Journaling. So I have gotten question in regards to how to effectively journal. One big thing about journaling is also on how you write positive things that happens to you on it. 

# Silence
Next thing Ryan spoke was on the habit of silence. It's really hard to silence your mind. Mainly cause silence isn't something that's built in. We get all sort of anxiety when we are silent. I feel it all the time where when I am silent - I feel afraid of being alone with my thoughts. 

# Wisdom
Next is about searching for wisdom. Wisdom is the study of philosophies and the art of living. Wisdom is about identifying what experts or people who you look up to have done. What actually ticked them. 

# No Ego
Stillness require you to have no ego. You shouldn’t fuel your enthusiasm or your drive with negative energy such as anger, jealousy, resentment. Your ego will get in the way of being still if you start to feel these emotions. Imposter syndrome is another thing you’d notice when it comes to Ego. You’d tend to not see where you are confident about. Confidence is the counter balance of Ego. When ever you feel like you have ego, ask yourself what does confidence looks like. 

# Let Go
For upcoming talent or people, the toughest part is letting go. Even for me - I am usually very tight, being very type A. But the truth is - mastery is achieved when you can be formless. Letting go is the art of being formless. Being formless gets you one step towards stillness. 


# Domain of the Spirit

# Choosing Virtue
You don’t always have a choice on how the world works. But you always have a choice on how you’d react. When you are reacting - always try to act in virtue. Virtue is the life principles of knowing what’s good and bad. If you have a strong moral compass of virtue, you’d have a strong spirit. 

# Heal the inner child
In our childhood, we have gotten affected in different ways and we have some wounds. We need to understand and heal these wounds in order for us to be better. An example of this is when Leonardo Da Vinci is looking for the love he never received from his father. 


These wounds you have from childhood affects your professional life more than you think. Try to list down all things that triggers inside of you for about a month and then next month try to spend time digging a bit deeper on these issues looking back at your childhood. When have you been hurt before. This is the idea that past pain body keeps on haunting you. 

Personally I have noticed the Victim mentality in my come up from time to time. This robes me of the happiness in the world. Also it makes me operate very badly on a daily basis - as an entrepreneur I am always existing on a plain of impossibility. Having the victim mentality is an added burden.

Next mentality I don’t like is the idea that the world is out there to get me. I think I have cultivated this idea in my head - and because of that I don’t find it easy to live. 

I had a dream recently where it was place in the school days. I was told by one of the teachers that you are only doing this Entrepreneur path because you couldn't hack any path else. You are failure and this is your coping mechanism. 

I have also seen my father talking to me and saying that success is important and that I should ride a Discovery or some big vehicle. From young days - I use to carry myself as if I was somebody. But even when I am somebody I don't know how to carry myself. All of these little pains add up and make it different.

There is another part where I feel like Sasmini might leave me and because of that I have this fear of detachment. That fear actually causes me to do things that are not healthy. 

# Beware Desire

Desire is what springs out of 7 deadly sins. 

**Lust** 
Chastity or self-control cures lust by controlling passion and leveraging that energy for the good of others.

**Gluttony**
Temperance cures gluttony by implanting the desire to be healthy, therefore making one fit to serve others.

**Greed**
Charity cures greed by putting the desire to help others above storing up treasure for one’s self.

**Sloth**
Diligence or zeal cures slothfulness by placing the interest of others above a life of ease and relaxation.

**Wrath**
Patience cures wrath by one first understanding the needs and desires of others before acting or speaking.

**Envy**
Kindness cures envy by placing the desire to help others above the need to supersede them.

**Pride**
Humility cures pride by removing one's ego and boastfulness, therefore allowing the attitude of service.

When you notice a desire, take time and sit with it. Try to understand what you’d feel after you consume that desire. Would you feel good. Would you feel like you have gone against your morale principles? 

I think the toughest here is accepting that falling pray to moving desires isn’t helping you achieve stillness. You have goals in life which allows you to live the life you want. And how you maintain your inner sanity is with stillness. Stillness requires you to curb your desires. This is a #morality problem. 

# Enough
One of the things I have been reading on being enough is on the idea that 

# Bathe in Nature
Take time to be in nature. Nature is the best place to see the beauty of the world. Take time to enjoy the present moment and see the beauty in things around you. Enjoy the beauty of the morning sun, enjoy the beauty of the morning traffic. 

# Accept a Higher Power
It's important to identify there is a higher power. I call it the universe. Universe contains all the energies around it. The universe has an enormous impact in our lives. So I pray, and let the universe manifest good things to me. I do things to attract good energy to me. I do things to minimize bad energy from me. There definitely is a higher power that springs up from the universe and that power conspires to make me win.

# Invest in Relationships




# Domain of the Body

# Say No
It's important to say no to opportunities in life. This is a really hard concept for us to grasp cause earlier on our career we get somewhere by saying Yes. I think there needs to be a better framework or thoughts on how to say Yes. Ideally if there is an asymmetric upside, that would be a higher bet. If saying Yes compromises your life principles, say no. If saying Yes gets you into messy situations in the future, say no. 

# Take a walk
In complexity of the mind, take a walk. It's actually for the body. The body needs walks to nourish it. It needs these walks to realize that life is beyond the problem that you are hyper fixated about. It's in those walks that you'd get strange realizations. These realizations will often save a lot headache and also get you out of the complexity in your mind. 

# Build a routine
It’s important to identify and build strong routines in your life. For me as a nomad this is a tough one but having these routines will make me anchor myself more. I’d need a morning routine, mid day routine and an evening routine. 

Sticking to these routines help me be in the meta context of what matters vs being totally inside a problem or a project. When I am totally inside a project it becomes all consuming and when it’s all consuming you don’t have clarity at all. 

With routines and being out of the world wind helps you modulate the ups and also modulate the downs. You get 700K funding, not a big deal. Your best employee leaves. Not a big deal. Being outside and inside at the same time allows you to have this level of zen. Routines help you to do that. 

Even for work sessions - I need to build a routine. A routine is when you plan a work session with all tasks in and then you work on them. Instead of thinking about - I have a shit ton of things to do. Being organized and having a system is very important. 

Master is in control. Master has a system. 
Master turns ordinary to sacred.

# Get rid of stuff
I should actively try to reduce the stuff I have. Document things I own, and then actively remove them. Actively remove stuff from the todo list. Actively remove out goals. Actively remove out people from your life. 

You also need to make sure that you don’t get into a lifestyle stuff. This goes into comforts that you get use to when you upgrade your life. Business class flights, apartments instead of small rooms. 

# Seek Solitude
Find time everyday for silence. This should be blocked in your calendar. Ideally no phone, no thoughts, no people but rather yourself doing something different. The idea is that you find time to reflect. 

Try to take a day a month to not have any calls, no conversations at all. Take a book and read. The idea is to be with your mind. And be present.

# Be a Human being
“Horses die of over working”

It’s important to conserve your energy so that you can be human. Have fun and always make sure to remove unnecessary projects/ unnecessary tasks out of your list. Clear your tasks and be a human.
